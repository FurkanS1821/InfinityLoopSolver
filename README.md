# InfinityLoopSolver
This is a program that can (theorically) solve [Infinity Loop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.balysv.loop) puzzles.

It does this with try/fail loop. 
This is not very time efficient (unless you use this in a quantum computer :P) since there are about 1 billion possibilities beyond level 100, and this number goes beyond the number of stars in Milky Way as you pass level 500.

Still, this can be developed to test less aleatory moves. Good luck with whoever does so.
